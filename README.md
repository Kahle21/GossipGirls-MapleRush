A fast-paced 2D side-scrolling runner built in Godot 4, where the player experiences Canadian history through different eras while collecting artifacts along the way.



🎮 About the Game



Canada Runner takes players through three historical eras:



Pre-Colonial Era – Learn about Indigenous culture and heritage.



Confederation Era – Experience Canada’s path to becoming a nation.
